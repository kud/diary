Yesterday, I was playing with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and I wanted to change the style of my `<Layout/>` component injected into another component for a specific case but I didn't understand why it didn't work when I extended it.

Imagine this:

```javascript
// layout.js

const Root = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  height: 100vh;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #ffffff;
`

const Main = styled.div``
const Aside = styled.div``

class Layout extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { children, aside } = this.props

    return (
      <Root>
        <Main>{children}</Main>

        {aside && <Aside>{aside}</Aside>}
      </Root>
    )
  }
}

export default Layout
```

```javascript
// page.js

const AnotherLayout = styled(Layout)`
  background-color: #333;
`

class Page extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <AnotherLayout>{"Hello!"}</AnotherLayout>
  }
}

export default Page
```

As you can see here, I extended my `<Layout>` to change the property `background-color`. However, when I did that, nothing happened and I was wondering why.

The reason is that you need to also transfer the `className`. Ha!

The trick is here, in `layout.js`, add the `className`.

```javascript
// layout.js

class Layout extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { className, children, aside } = this.props

    return (
      <Root className={className}>
        {...}
      </Root>
    )
  }
}

export default Layout
```

and now, it is fine! (works also on emotion). üôè
