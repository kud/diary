Wow, this is my first page with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I'm so glad of it! ðŸ™Œ

And as it is my first deploy on GitHub too, I had just a little problem with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Indeed, as you could know, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as default, and one of theirs convention is to use `_` as prefix of any folder which are used for the templating, not the final `dist`. Sounds not bad like that, but [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) also uses a folder called `_next` for distributed assets.

So yeah, the first time I deployed my blog, it was so weird, no assets were available. ðŸ˜±

I finally found [the solution on the GitHub blog](https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/).

You simply must add an empty file called `.nojekyll` in order that GitHub doesn't think you're in a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) environment. Done!

By the way, if you use the excellent command line [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages), do not forget to use the parameter `--dotfiles` to also deploy this new file.
