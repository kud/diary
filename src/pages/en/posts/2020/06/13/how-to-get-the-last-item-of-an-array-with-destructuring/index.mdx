Today, we'll see a little trick to get the last item of an array with destructuring.

As you may already know, [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) is a way to unpack values from an array. It's really useful to create some variables really quickly.

So let's say we've got an array of numbers like that:

```js
const arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

## destructuring

In this array, we want the first element that we'll call `a`, so this is where destructuring will be useful:

```js
const [a] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

As you can imagine, `a` will return `10`.

## rest?

Now, we want to take the first one, the second one, but also the rest.

```js
const [a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

In this way, you'll get those return values:

```js
const [a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

console.log(a) // 10
console.log(b) // 20
console.log(rest) // [30, 40, 50]
```

(By the way, `rest` can be called as you prefer as long as you use `...` before).

## slice

Now, and this is the trick of this post, we want the last item of this array. In other way, we want a variable with the value `50`.

For that, we'll use `slice(-1)`.

```js
const [a] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].slice(-1)

console.log(a) // 50
```

---

A little note, be careful with this way because using `slice(-1)` only keeps the last item, so:

```js
const [a, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].slice(-1)

console.log(a) // 50
console.log(rest) // []
```

## reverse

Another way could be to use `reverse()` like:

```js
const [a, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].reverse()

console.log(a) // 50
console.log(rest) // [40, 30, 20, 10]
```

## ðŸ’¡ idea

The reason of this post is that I was a bit surprised at first not to be able to do:

```js
const [a, ...rest, z] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

console.log(a) // 10
console.log(rest) // [20, 30, 40]
console.log(z) // [50]
```

It sounded logical to me. I'd be interested of your point of view about this.
