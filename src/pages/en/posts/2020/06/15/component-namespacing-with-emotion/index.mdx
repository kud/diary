Naming, naming, naming. Oh god. One of the hardest part in computer science. Fortunately, we've got some conventions about that which help us not to overthink every time we must name something.

For instance, there's one: [BEM](http://getbem.com/).

## BEM

I'm a BEM lover for ages. The first time I saw this method, I understood quickly it was a really great way to avoid conflict between elements and - <abbr title="In My Opinion">IMO</abbr> - to remove all the painful part of CSS. (You've got a good article about this on [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)).

Before using [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) or [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/), my stylesheet code was something like that:

```css
.MyBlock {
  [...]
}

.MyBlock-myElement {
  [...]
}

.MyBlock-myElement--myModifier {
  [...]
}
```

It is not exactly [the ✌️ official ✌️ convention](http://getbem.com/naming/) ([you've got different ones in fact](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/)) but for some reasons like readability or double-clicking on name to select, this was the convention I used and it worked really well!

But this is a different time and now I mostly use Emotion to create my styled components.

## Emotion

So let's begin about how to namespace your components.

Here is a basic example:

```jsx
import styled from "@emotion/styled"

const MyStyledComponent = styled.div``
```

Alright, now let's imagine now we've got two components: one parent, one child.

The classic way could be:

```jsx
const Parent = styled.div``

const Child = styled.div``
```

We want now to adjust `Child` depending on triggering a hover on `Parent`.

We can write this:

```jsx
const Parent = styled.div`
  &:hover ${Child} {
    color: red;
  }
`

const Child = styled.div``
```

Great.

But as a BEM fan, I rather prefer to write my code like this:

```jsx
const MyBlock = styled.div`
  &:hover ${MyBlockMyElement} {
    color: red;
  }
`

const MyBlockMyElement = styled.div``
```

This is cool because you know that your element depends on a block. But when you want to export, you'll get something like:

```jsx
// my-component.js
export const MyBlock = styled.div`
  &:hover ${MyBlockMyElement} {
    color: red;
  }
`

export const MyBlockMyElement = styled.div``
```

```jsx
// app.js
import { MyBlock, MyBlockMyElement } from "./my-component"
```

Nope. It is unpleasant to read now.

A solution could be to create a namespace by using objects.

```jsx
// my-component.js
const MyComponent = styled.div``

MyComponent.MyElement = styled.div``

export default MyBlock
```

which is great because you can do:

```jsx
// app.js
import MyComponent from "./my-component"

const MyApp = () => (
  <MyComponent>
    <MyComponent.MyElement />
  </MyComponent>
)
```

Elegant, no?

This is my favourite way to write namespaced components. 🙌🏻

## Oh noes!

But, there's a _but_. 😬

Did you remember when we added a `:hover` trigger? Let's try with this convention:

```jsx
// my-component.js
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  &:hover ${MyComponent.MyElement} {
    color: red;
  }
`

MyComponent.MyElement = styled.div``

export default MyBlock
```

By doing this, you'll get this error:

```
🙅‍♂️ can't access property "MyElement", MyComponent is undefined
```

Well, it is quite obvious as at this moment, `MyComponent` doesn't exist yet.

_🗣 So you told us to use namespacing via objects but it seems that it creates some issues now!._

Yes, that's right but I still find that this convention is elegant and I want to go deeper with it. So how could we do?

## The trick

Well, after looking into the github issues of emotion, I found a solution, it is just to create an anonymous function which returns the child!

```jsx
// my-component.js
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  &:hover ${() => MyComponent.MyElement} {
    color: red;
  }
`

MyComponent.MyElement = styled.div``

export default MyBlock
```

Boom! 💥

Be careful however to use the [babel-plugin-emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled#targeting-another-emotion-component) to do that.

Bye bye and see you soon!
